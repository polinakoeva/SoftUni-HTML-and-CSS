                <h4>The Woman Who Outruns the Men, 200 Miles at a Time</h4>
                <p>Courtney Dauwalter specializes in extremely long races. But her success in winning them has opened a debate about how men’s innate strength advantages apply to endurance sports.</p>
                <p>She saw live puppets playing on a swing set on the side of the trail. Trees and rocks turned into faces. She was on her second night without sleep, 165 miles into a 205-mile race through the mountains, pushing her body to levels considered physically impossible not long ago, and seeing very strange things in the night.</p>

                <h4>V.A.R. at the Women’s World Cup? FIFA Still Won’t Say</h4>
                <p>PARIS — As the men’s World Cup was winding down last summer in Russia, FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, used his final news conference to heap praise on the video assistant referee system, which had been used for the first time at the tournament. It had become, Infantino declared, “difficult to think about the World Cup without V.A.R.”</p>
                <p>It remains to be seen whether Infantino was referring only to the men’s game when he essentially called the technology indispensable.</p>
                <p>To the dismay of some top players and coaches in the women’s game, FIFA, the governing body of international soccer, has not confirmed whether V.A.R. will be used at the Women’s World Cup next summer in France.</p>
